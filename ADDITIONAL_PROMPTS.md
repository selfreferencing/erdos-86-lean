## PROMPT 2.4: The Hardest Case [Run 2 instances]

**Context**: Among all primes p ≡ 1 (mod 4) up to 800,000 where Type II (G=0 criterion) fails at all k ≤ 5, the prime p = 532249 requires the largest k for rescue.

**Data for p = 532249**:
- Type II (G=0) fails at k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
- Type II (G=0) first succeeds at k = 13
- Type I fails at k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
- Type I first succeeds at k = 12 with witness d = 31463
- Rescue method: Type I at k = 12

**Your tasks**:

1. **Compute the n_k sequence** for p = 532249, k = 0 to 15:
   - n_k = (532249 + 4k + 3)/4
   - Factor each n_k
   - For each, check if it's QR-trapped mod m_k = 4k+3, or if it's prime with n_k ≢ -1 (mod m_k)

2. **Analyze Type I failures** at k = 1 through 11:
   - For each k, compute kp + 1 and factor it
   - What is -p (mod 4k)?
   - What subgroup of (Z/4kZ)* is generated by the prime factors?
   - Why doesn't this subgroup contain -p?

3. **Why does k = 12 finally work?**
   - 12p + 1 = 6386989. Factor this.
   - How does d = 31463 satisfy d ≡ -p (mod 48)?
   - What's special about k = 12 that k = 1-11 lack?

4. **Characterize p = 532249**:
   - Compute p mod 504735, p mod 120, p mod 24
   - Is there a specific residue class that makes primes "extra hard"?

5. **Prediction**: Based on this analysis, could there exist a prime requiring k > 12? What would it look like?

## PROMPT 2.5: The Common Witness Divisors [Run 2 instances]

**Observation from Phase 1**: Among the 57 G-dangerous primes < 800K, certain small primes appear repeatedly as Type I witnesses:

| Witness d | Primes rescued | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| 31 | 5 | p = 87481, 94441, 483289, 66529, 532249 |
| 47 | 7 | p = 224401, 242449, 400009, 526681, 534601, 757201, ... |
| 71 | 3 | p = 388369, 496609, 691681 |
| 191 | 3 | p = 118801, 684289, 789721 |

**Your tasks**:

1. **For d = 31**:
   - Type I at k requires 31 | (kp+1) and 31 ≡ -p (mod 4k)
   - For which k values can 31 be a witness? (i.e., 31 ≡ some -p mod 4k)
   - If 31 | (kp+1), then p ≡ -1/k (mod 31). List the (k, p mod 31) pairs.

2. **For d = 47**:
   - Same analysis: which (k, p mod 47) pairs allow 47 as witness?

3. **Universal rescue primes**: Is there a small prime q that can rescue ANY dangerous prime at some k?
   - For q to rescue p at k: q | (kp+1) AND q ≡ -p (mod 4k)
   - The first condition gives p ≡ -1/k (mod q)
   - The second gives q ≡ -p (mod 4k), so p ≡ -q (mod 4k)
   - Can these be satisfied for all p in some residue class?

4. **The rescue network**: Build a graph where:
   - Nodes are the 57 dangerous primes
   - Edges connect primes that share a witness divisor d
   - What's the structure of this graph? Are there clusters?

5. **Prediction**: If we extend to primes > 800K, which small primes (31, 47, 71, etc.) will continue to be effective witnesses?

## PROMPT 2.6: The Prime n_k Cases [Run 2 instances]

**Key Phase 1 Finding**: Of the 57 G-dangerous primes:
- 21 are QR-dangerous (all n_k are composite with QR-trapped factors)
- 36 are G-only dangerous (some n_k is prime with n_k ≢ -1 mod m_k)

**The difference matters**: G(n, m) = 0 for prime n just requires n ≢ -1 (mod m), NOT that n is a QR.

**Your tasks**:

1. **Identify which n_k are prime** for the 36 "G-only" primes:
   - For example, p = 21169: n_4 = 5297 is prime, and 5297 ≡ 15 ≢ 18 = -1 (mod 19)
   - List (p, k, n_k) triples where n_k is prime

2. **The constraint n ≢ -1 (mod m)**:
   - For prime n_k, G(n_k, m_k) = 0 ⟺ n_k ≢ -1 (mod m_k)
   - This is equivalent to: (p + 4k + 3)/4 ≢ -1 (mod 4k+3)
   - Simplify: p ≢ -4 - 4k - 3 = -4k - 7 (mod 4(4k+3))
   - What residue classes of p make n_k ≡ -1 (mod m_k)?

3. **Why prime n_k helps the "dangerous" property**:
   - If n_k is prime and n_k ≢ -1 (mod m_k), then G = 0 regardless of QR status
   - Does having prime n_k make it EASIER or HARDER to be dangerous overall?

4. **Prime n_k and Type I rescue**:
   - When n_k is prime, the bridge identity gcd(n_k, kp+1) | (4k² + 3k - 1) gives:
     - Either n_k | (4k² + 3k - 1), OR
     - gcd(n_k, kp+1) = 1
   - For which k does n_k divide 4k² + 3k - 1?
   - Does prime n_k affect Type I success?

5. **The "double prime" cases**: Are there dangerous primes p where MULTIPLE n_k are prime? Does this make rescue harder?
