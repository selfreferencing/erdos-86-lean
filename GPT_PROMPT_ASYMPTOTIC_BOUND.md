# TASK: Find Asymptotic Bound for Hard10 Coverage

## Context

We need to prove that K10 = {5,7,9,11,14,17,19,23,26,29} covers all "Hard10" primes (Mordell-hard primes not covered by k ∈ {0,1,2}).

**Verified computationally:** All Hard10 primes ≤ 10^7 have K10 witnesses.

## Goal

Find an explicit bound N such that:
> For all Hard10 primes p > N, at least one k ∈ K10 provides a Type II witness.

Then the theorem reduces to finite verification for p ≤ N.

## The Type II Witness Condition

For k ∈ K10 with m_k = 4k + 3:
- x_k = (p + m_k) / 4
- Witness exists iff: ∃ d | x_k², d ≤ x_k, d ≡ -x_k (mod m_k)

## Key Observations

### 1. Large x_k Has Many Divisors

For p > N, each x_k ≈ p/4 is large, so x_k² has many divisors.

The number of divisors τ(x_k²) grows with the number of prime factors of x_k.

### 2. Divisor Density Argument

The divisors of x_k² that are ≤ x_k span residue classes mod m_k.

If x_k has r distinct prime factors, the divisors generate a subgroup of (Z/m_k Z)* of size ≥ 2^r (roughly).

For large x_k, we expect r ≥ log log x_k prime factors on average.

### 3. The Target Must Be Hit

The target residue is -x_k mod m_k.

If the subgroup generated by divisors has index 1 or 2 in (Z/m_k Z)*, the target is very likely reachable.

## Proposed Approach

### Step 1: Lower Bound on Prime Factors

For x > X_0, prove that x has at least ω(x) ≥ f(x) distinct prime factors (for some function f).

By the Hardy-Ramanujan theorem, ω(n) ~ log log n on average.

### Step 2: Subgroup Size Estimate

If x_k has r distinct odd prime factors, the divisors of x_k² generate residues in (Z/m_k Z)*.

Estimate: With high probability over "random" factorizations, the generated subgroup covers at least half of (Z/m_k Z)*.

### Step 3: Probability of Missing All 10

If each k ∈ K10 independently has probability ε of failing, then all 10 fail with probability ε^10.

For p large enough, this probability becomes negligible.

### Step 4: Explicit Bound

Combine the above to find N such that:
- For p > N, the probability that ALL k ∈ K10 fail is < 1/(number of Hard10 primes > N)
- This implies no Hard10 prime > N can fail all K10

## Alternative: Covering Congruences

Perhaps there's a covering system: for each residue class of p mod M (for some M), at least one k ∈ K10 is guaranteed to work.

This would give a finite verification bound directly.

## Deliverables

1. **An explicit bound N** (ideally N ≤ 10^7 so it's already verified)

2. **A rigorous proof** that for Hard10 primes p > N, some k ∈ K10 works

3. **If possible:** A complete proof without any finite verification (purely asymptotic)

## Data Point

The largest Hard10 prime ≤ 10^7 that requires k=29 (the "last resort" in K10) is quite small. The K10 cascade is very efficient:
- k=5 catches 64% of Hard10 primes
- k=7 catches 21%
- k=9 catches 8%
- k=11 catches 4%
- Higher k catches < 3% combined

This suggests the asymptotic bound might be quite tractable.
