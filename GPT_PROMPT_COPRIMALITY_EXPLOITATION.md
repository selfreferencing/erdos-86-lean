# TASK: Exploit Coprimality Structure of K10 Shifts

## Context

We're proving K10 = {5,7,9,11,14,17,19,23,26,29} covers all "Hard10" Mordell-hard primes (those not covered by k ∈ {0,1,2}).

**Key structural fact:** For primes ℓ > 24, ℓ divides at most ONE of the ten values x_k = r + k.

Proof: gcd(x_i, x_j) = gcd(r+i, r+j) divides |i-j|. Max |i-j| in K10 is 29-5 = 24.

## The Coprimality Principle

This means: **Large primes "belong" to exactly one k.**

If ℓ > 24 and ℓ | x_k, then:
- ℓ ∤ x_j for all j ≠ k in K10
- The "witness contribution" of ℓ is isolated to k

## How This Creates Coupling

For Hard10 prime p to fail ALL k ∈ K10:
- Each x_k must avoid having a "bad" prime factor (one with (ℓ/m_k) = -1)
- But the x_k values share the parameter r
- Large primes partition across the x_k values

## The Pigeonhole Insight

Consider primes ℓ in the range (24, X) for some bound X.

Each such ℓ divides exactly one x_k (determined by r mod ℓ = -k).

For the obstruction O_k to hold, we need (ℓ/m_k) = +1 whenever ℓ | x_k.

**Question:** Can r be chosen so that for EVERY large prime ℓ:
- If r ≡ -k (mod ℓ), then (ℓ/m_k) = +1?

## The Covering Challenge

Define:
- Bad(k) = {ℓ prime : (ℓ/m_k) = -1} (bad primes for k)
- Avoid(ℓ) = {-k mod ℓ : (ℓ/m_k) = -1} (residues to avoid for ℓ)

For r to fail all K10, we need:
```
r mod ℓ ∉ Avoid(ℓ) for all primes ℓ > 24
```

## YOUR TASK

1. **Analyze the structure of Avoid(ℓ)** for primes ℓ > 24

2. **Show the avoidance is impossible** for large enough r:
   - Count how many residue classes are forbidden
   - Show they eventually cover all possibilities

3. **Find an explicit bound:** Beyond what r can avoidance not hold?

4. **Key insight to exploit:** The sets Bad(k) for different k are "independent" in some sense (different m_k values). Use this to show the avoidance conditions conflict.

## Useful Observations

For prime ℓ > 24:
- Exactly one k has ℓ | x_k (the one with r ≡ -k mod ℓ)
- For each k, roughly half of primes ℓ have (ℓ/m_k) = -1

So for "random" ℓ > 24:
- There's a ~50% chance that the unique k with ℓ | x_k has (ℓ/m_k) = -1
- This would break the obstruction for that k

The question: Can r be specially chosen to always land on the "good" k?

## Deliverable

A proof (or strong evidence) that:
> For r > R₀ (explicit bound), there exists ℓ > 24 such that ℓ | x_k and (ℓ/m_k) = -1 for some k ∈ K10.

This would show the obstruction cannot hold for all k simultaneously.
