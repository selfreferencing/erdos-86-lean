# Phase 5 Prompt Fleet: Closing the Proof Gaps

## Date: January 21, 2025

## Context for All Prompts

We have established:
1. **Witness condition**: -1 ∈ B(x_k) where B(x_k) = {∏ q_i^{t_i} : -e_i ≤ t_i ≤ e_i}
2. **Obstruction is quadratic**: Failure ⟺ ∃ odd χ with χ(q) = +1 for all q|x_k
3. **Heuristic bound**: P(all 23 fail) ~ (log p)^{-11.5}
4. **Empirical**: 100% coverage of 179,468 primes up to 10^8

**Goal**: Convert heuristic to rigorous proof, or find an algebraic approach.

## Prompt 41: Single-Modulus Sieve Bound

```
RIGOROUS SIEVE BOUND FOR ESC TYPE II WITNESSES

Setup:
- Fix k ∈ K_COMPLETE with m_k = 4k + 3
- For prime p ≡ 1 (mod 4), define x_k = (p + m_k)/4 = n + k + 1 where n = (p-1)/4
- Let χ be an odd quadratic character mod m_k (χ(-1) = -1)

Define the "failure event" for (k, χ):
F_{k,χ}(p) = [χ(q) = +1 for all primes q | x_k]

Heuristically:
- Primes q with χ(q) = +1 have density 1/2 (Chebotarev)
- Integers composed only of such primes: count ≍ X(log X)^{-1/2}
- So P(F_{k,χ}) ≈ C/(log p)^{1/2}

QUESTION: Can we prove a rigorous upper bound:

#{p ≤ X : p ≡ 1 (mod 4), F_{k,χ}(p)} ≤ C · X/(log X)^{3/2}

The technical challenges:
1. x_k = (p + m_k)/4 is a shifted value, not a random integer
2. Need uniformity in the implicit constants as k varies over K_COMPLETE
3. The condition "all prime factors satisfy χ(q) = +1" is a multiplicative constraint

Possible tools:
- Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem (unconditional, but limited range)
- GRH (gives strong uniformity)
- Selberg-Delange method for integers with restricted prime factors

Can you:
1. State a precise theorem (conditional or unconditional)
2. Identify which known results it would follow from
3. Indicate the key technical steps in the proof

## Prompt 42: Independence Across Moduli

```
INDEPENDENCE STRUCTURE IN ESC COVERAGE

For each k ∈ K_COMPLETE, define:
- x_k = (p + m_k)/4 = n + k + 1
- F_k = event that -1 ∉ B(x_k) (no witness for modulus m_k)

The key observation: All x_k share the same prime factorization structure!

If p = 4n + 1, then:
x_0 = n + 1
x_1 = n + 2
x_2 = n + 3
...
x_{41} = n + 42

These are 23 consecutive-ish integers (with gaps). They share some prime factors but not all.

QUESTION: How independent are the failure events F_k?

Naive bound (no independence): P(∩ F_k) ≤ min_k P(F_k) ≈ (log p)^{-1/2}

Full independence bound: P(∩ F_k) ≈ ∏_k P(F_k) ≈ (log p)^{-11.5}

The truth is somewhere between. Key observations:

1. The quadratic characters χ_k mod m_k are independent (different moduli)
2. A prime q | x_j implies q | gcd(x_j, x_k) = gcd(j-k, x_k) for certain k
3. Small primes (q ≤ 42) might divide multiple x_k values
4. Large primes (q > 42) divide at most one x_k

QUESTION: Can we prove something like:

P(∩_k F_k) ≤ C · (log p)^{-A}

for some A > 1? Even A = 2 would give a strong result (finite exceptional set via Borel-Cantelli).

Possible approach:
- Separate the contribution of small primes (q ≤ 42) from large primes
- For large primes, different x_k have essentially independent factorizations
- The characters χ_k act independently on these large prime factors

Can you formalize this independence argument?

## Prompt 43: Box Equals Subgroup for Small Moduli

```
BOX VS. SUBGROUP CONDITION FOR ESC WITNESSES

The exact witness condition is:
-1 ∈ B(x) where B(x) = {∏ q_i^{t_i} : -e_i ≤ t_i ≤ e_i}

Here x = ∏ q_i^{e_i} and the t_i range from -e_i to +e_i.

The subgroup condition is:
-1 ∈ H_x where H_x = ⟨q_i mod m : q_i | x⟩

Clearly B(x) ⊆ H_x, so:
- Box condition ⟹ Subgroup condition
- Subgroup condition does NOT automatically ⟹ Box condition

QUESTION: For our moduli m_k ≤ 167, when does H_x = B(x)?

Key observation: For small groups, the box is often large enough to equal H_x.

Example: m = 23, so |(ℤ/23)*| = 22.

If x = q₁^{e₁} · q₂^{e₂} with e₁, e₂ ≥ 1, then:
- H_x = ⟨q₁, q₂⟩ (subgroup generated by two elements)
- B(x) contains at least: 1, q₁, q₁², q₂, q₂², q₁q₂, q₁²q₂, q₁q₂², q₁²q₂², and their inverses mod ratios

The box has size roughly (2e₁+1)(2e₂+1)... which can exceed 22 quickly.

SPECIFIC QUESTION: Can we prove that for m ≤ 167 and x with ω(x) ≥ 3:
- B(x) = H_x, OR
- -1 ∈ H_x ⟹ -1 ∈ B(x)

This would let us use the simpler subgroup formulation in our proofs.

Alternative: If the box condition is strictly stronger, quantify how much stronger. What fraction of "subgroup successes" are also "box successes"?

## Prompt 44: Explicit Character Covering Argument

```
ALGEBRAIC APPROACH TO ESC COVERAGE

Instead of probabilistic arguments, consider an algebraic approach:

For each p ≡ 1 (mod 4), we need to show that for SOME k ∈ K_COMPLETE:
∃ prime q | x_k such that χ_k(q) = -1

where χ_k is an odd quadratic character mod m_k.

REFORMULATION: We need to show that for each p, the set
{primes q : q | x_k for some k ∈ K_COMPLETE}
is NOT entirely contained in any single "split prime" set
{q : χ(q) = +1 for all odd χ mod m_k for some fixed k}

The key constraint: The x_k values are n+1, n+2, ..., n+42 (with some gaps).

QUESTION 1: What is the structure of primes dividing at least one of x_0, x_1, ..., x_{41}?

For a prime q, it divides x_k ⟺ q | (n + k + 1) ⟺ n ≡ -(k+1) (mod q)

So for each q, exactly one x_k is divisible by q (when k+1 ≡ -n (mod q) and 0 ≤ k ≤ 41).

QUESTION 2: Can we show that for each p, the set of primes q appearing in ∪_k {q : q | x_k} has enough "variety" that it can't all be split for any single character?

EXPLICIT APPROACH:
- List the 23 moduli and their odd quadratic characters
- For each character χ_k, identify the "bad primes" (those with χ_k(q) = +1)
- Show that no p can have ALL its x_k prime factors be bad for their respective χ_k

This would be a finite, explicit verification rather than an asymptotic argument.

Can you:
1. Identify if this algebraic approach is feasible
2. Suggest what explicit computation would verify it
3. Indicate if there's a pattern that makes this tractable

## Prompt 45: Salez Filter Completeness (Bonus)

```
VERIFYING SALEZ FILTER COMPLETENESS FOR K_COMPLETE

Salez's approach (arXiv:1406.6307) defines filter sets S_m for each modulus m.

For our moduli m_k = 4k + 3:
- S_{m_k} = set of residue classes r (mod m_k) for which p ≡ r gives a solution
- Shortened filters S*_m account for redundancy from divisors

Our K_COMPLETE corresponds to moduli:
3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 39, 47, 55, 59, 67, 71, 79, 87, 95, 103, 107, 119, 127, 159, 167

QUESTION: Do the combined filter sets cover all residue classes?

Specifically, let M = lcm(3, 7, 11, 15, ..., 167).

For each residue class r (mod M), is r ∈ S_{m_k} (mod m_k) for at least one k?

This is a finite computation:
1. Compute all S_{m_k} sets
2. Use CRT to check coverage of (ℤ/Mℤ)*

QUESTIONS:
1. Can you describe how to compute S_m for a given modulus m in the (14a) family?
2. What is the expected size of ∪_k S_{m_k} as a fraction of (ℤ/Mℤ)*?
3. If not 100% coverage, what additional moduli would be needed?

This would directly verify that K_COMPLETE is sufficient (if coverage is complete) or identify gaps (if not).

## Summary

| Prompt | Target Lemma | Approach |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| 41 | Single-modulus sieve | Analytic (BV/GRH) |
| 42 | Independence across moduli | Large sieve / correlation |
| 43 | Box = Subgroup | Algebraic / group theory |
| 44 | Explicit covering | Finite verification |
| 45 | Salez completeness | Direct computation |

## Recommended Strategy

**Parallel track 1** (Prompts 41-42): Probabilistic/analytic approach
- Requires serious number theory
- Would give asymptotic result with possibly finite exceptions

**Parallel track 2** (Prompts 43-45): Algebraic/computational approach
- More elementary but explicit
- Could give complete verification if tractable

Send 41 + 44 first to see which track is more promising.
