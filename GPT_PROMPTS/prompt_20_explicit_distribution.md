# GPT Prompt 20: Explicit Distribution Requirements for the 74-Pair Budget

## Context (follow-up to your previous response)

In your previous response (prompt 12), you offered to "take our most concrete finite search region claim (4*alpha*s^2 <= 200) and translate it into an explicit finite list of congruence conditions on prime factors p (mod 4*alpha*s), and then show exactly what kind of distribution statement about prime divisors would be sufficient."

We are accepting that offer. Here is the full context.

## What we have

We are trying to prove the Erdos-Straus conjecture for primes P === 1 (mod 24), P >= 10^6. This reduces to:

**For every such P, there exist positive integers alpha, s, r such that (4*alpha*s*r - 1) divides (P + 4*alpha*s^2).**

Equivalently: P + 4*alpha*s^2 has a divisor d with d === -1 (mod 4*alpha*s).

We use the budget K = 4*alpha*s^2 <= 200, which gives 74 (alpha, s) pairs. Empirically, zero primes P === 1 (mod 24) up to 10^7 fail all 74 pairs simultaneously.

## What we now know (from prompts 12-19)

1. **Character-kernel lemma (prompt 14):** "No divisor === -1 (mod m)" is equivalent to: there exists an odd quadratic character chi (mod m) with chi(-1) = -1 whose kernel contains all prime factors of N coprime to m.

2. **Selberg sieve bound (prompt 16):** #{P <= X : all 74 pairs fail} << X/(log X)^{delta(200)} where delta(200) = Sum_{4*alpha*s^2 <= 200} 1/phi(4*alpha*s) ~ 4.79.

3. **No finite covering works locally (prompt 12):** For any finite set of alphas, Chebotarev gives primes p making all of them QRs. But this local impossibility does NOT rule out a global argument.

4. **The "sufficient conjecture" (prompt 19):** For large P === 1 (mod 24), exists s <= P^eps with P + 4s^2 having a prime factor q === -1 (mod 4s).

## What I need from you

### Task 1: Enumerate the 74 pairs and their congruence requirements

For each (alpha, s) pair with 4*alpha*s^2 <= 200, list:
- The modulus m = 4*alpha*s
- The target residue class: d === -1 (mod m)
- Which odd quadratic characters chi (mod m) have chi(-1) = -1 (these are the "bad" characters)
- The kernel of each bad character (the "forbidden" set of prime residues)

For example, for (alpha=1, s=1): m = 4, bad character is chi(n) = (-1/n) (the Legendre symbol mod 4), kernel = {1 mod 4}. So failure means: all prime factors of P+4 are === 1 (mod 4).

### Task 2: For each pair, state the "forbidden semigroup" precisely

For pair (alpha_i, s_i), let N_i = P + 4*alpha_i*s_i^2. Failure for this pair means N_i lies in the multiplicative semigroup generated by primes in the kernel of some bad character chi_i (mod 4*alpha_i*s_i).

Give the explicit list of which primes (by residue class mod m_i) are "allowed" vs "forbidden" for each pair.

### Task 3: State the distribution requirement that would suffice

Given the 74 pairs, state precisely:

**What property of the prime factorization of {P + 4*alpha_i*s_i^2 : i = 1, ..., 74} would guarantee that at least one pair succeeds?**

This should be a statement of the form: "If the prime factors of the 74 shifted values do not ALL fall into the respective forbidden semigroups, then ES holds for P."

Then: what distributional assumption about prime factors of polynomial values would guarantee this? Specifically:

(a) What is the weakest distributional hypothesis (on the joint distribution of prime factors of N_1, ..., N_74) that implies at least one pair works?

(b) Is this implied by any known or conjectured result? (e.g., Bombieri-Vinogradov with specific level of distribution, or Elliott-Halberstam, or a large sieve bound for real characters)

(c) Can you quantify: for what fraction of primes q <= z does q "help" at least one pair? If this fraction is bounded below by c > 0, does the sieve argument from prompt 16 already give enough?

### Task 4: Identify the "cheapest" pairs

Among the 74 pairs, which contribute the most to delta(200) = Sum 1/phi(4*alpha*s)? Rank them by 1/phi(m_i). Are there diminishing returns? Could a smaller subset (say 20-30 pairs) achieve delta > 2, which would already give density << (log X)^{-1} relative to primes?

### Task 5: The "joint failure" structure

For simultaneous failure of all 74 pairs, the prime P must satisfy 74 independent-looking conditions on the prime factors of 74 different integers. These integers differ by at most 200 (since 4*alpha*s^2 <= 200, all N_i are in [P+4, P+200]).

Are there primes q that simultaneously help MANY pairs? (i.e., q divides some N_i AND q lands outside the forbidden semigroup for that pair?) If a single prime q can help k pairs at once, the effective number of independent constraints is reduced.

Conversely: are there structural reasons why a single prime q CANNOT help multiple pairs simultaneously?

## Constraints

- Be fully explicit: list actual moduli, actual character kernels, actual forbidden residue classes.
- The output should be a "reference table" we can use for further analysis and for Lean formalization.
- If the computation is too large for all 74 pairs, do the first 20 (those with smallest 4*alpha*s^2) and explain the pattern.
