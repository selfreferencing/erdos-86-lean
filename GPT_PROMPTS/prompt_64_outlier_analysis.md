# Prompt 64: Deep Analysis of the k > 7 Outliers

## Context

From prompt 63C, we found that k ≤ 7 works for 247/250 hard primes tested, but three outliers require larger k:

| Prime p | Class (mod 840) | Required k | m = 3+4k |
|---------|-----------------|------------|----------|
| 67369 | 169 | k = 8 | m = 35 |
| 87481 | 121 | k = 15 | m = 63 |
| 118801 | 361 | k = 14 | m = 59 |

## Questions

### Q1: Detailed factorization analysis

For each of the three outliers, provide:

1. **x₀ = ⌈p/4⌉** and its complete factorization
2. **For each k from 0 to (required k - 1):**
   - x_k = x₀ + k
   - Factorization of x_k
   - The modulus m_k = 3 + 4k
   - The required residue class for e (mod m_k)
   - Why no divisor of x_k² hits that residue class

### Q2: The residue-subgroup obstruction

For each failed k value:
- What subgroup of (Z/m_k Z)× is generated by the prime factors of x_k?
- What residue class is required?
- Is the required class outside the generated subgroup?

### Q3: What finally works?

For the successful k value:
- What is x and its factorization?
- What divisor e works?
- Why does this e hit the required class when smaller k failed?
- Is there a "new prime factor" that appears at the successful k?

### Q4: Is there a pattern?

Looking at all three outliers:
- Do they share structural properties?
- Are their x₀ values unusually "smooth" or "rough"?
- Do they have unusually few prime factors?
- Are all prime factors in specific residue classes?

### Q5: Density estimate

Based on the obstruction patterns you identify:
- Can you estimate how rare such outliers should be?
- Should we expect finitely many, or infinitely many with density 0?
- Is there a heuristic for the "probability" that a prime needs k > 7?

### Q6: Can the outliers be characterized?

Is there a necessary condition for a prime to need k > 7?

For example: "p needs k > 7 only if x₀ has all prime factors in [specific residue classes]"

If such a condition exists, we could:
1. Prove the condition is rarely satisfied
2. Or enumerate all primes satisfying it up to some bound

## Goal

Understand WHY these three primes are outliers, and whether:
1. They represent a finite exceptional set
2. They follow a pattern that allows characterization
3. The obstruction can be overcome with a different approach
