# GPT Prompt: Quantitative Digit Independence for Zeroless Powers of 2

## Role

You are a research mathematician specializing in analytic number theory and combinatorics. I need your help proving a quantitative digit-independence result that would establish finiteness in the Erdos 86 conjecture.

## Problem Background

**The Conjecture.** The set A = {n >= 1 : 2^n has no digit 0 in base 10} is finite. Computationally, A = {1,2,...,9, 13,14,15,16, 18,19, 24,25, 27,28, 31,32,33,34,35,36,37, 39, 49, 51, 67, 72, 76,77, 81, 86}, with 35 elements and largest element 86.

**What We Have Proved.** We have a complete, self-contained proof that A has natural density zero:

1. **5-adic orbit structure.** The sequence 2^n mod 10^m (for n >= m) is periodic with period T_m = 4 * 5^{m-1}. Each orbit element x = 2^m * u where u = 2^{n-m} mod 5^m ranges over the cyclic group generated by 2 in (Z/5^m Z)^*. Since 2 is a primitive root mod 5^m, this group has order T_m = phi(5^m).

2. **Fiber formula.** Define Z_m = count of level-m survivors (orbit elements whose last m digits are all nonzero). Classify survivors as even-type (u even) or odd-type (u odd), with counts E_m and O_m. Then:
   - Z_{m+1} = 4*E_m + 5*O_m
   - Each even parent gives 4 children (loses the child with leading digit 0)
   - Each odd parent gives 5 children (all leading digits are odd, hence nonzero)

3. **Parity splits.** Even parents produce 2 even + 2 odd children. Odd parents produce either 3 even + 2 odd or 2 even + 3 odd children, depending on u mod 4.

4. **Strong parity-balance.** |e_m - 1/2| = O((1/3)^m) where e_m = E_m/Z_m. This uses a mod-8 transfer matrix (doubly stochastic circulant) with spectral gap theta = 1/3.

5. **Density zero.** The survival rate S_m = Z_{m+1}/(5*Z_m) = 1 - e_m/5 = 9/10 + O((1/3)^m), giving Z_m/T_m -> 0 exponentially.

## The Finiteness Gap

Density zero says Z_m/T_m -> 0 but allows Z_m -> infinity (indeed Z_m ~ (9/2)^m). Finiteness requires: for large m, NO specific n > 86 survives at level D(n) = floor(n * log10(2)) + 1 (digit count of 2^n).

**Key reduction.** A zeroless 2^n requires n to survive at level D(n). Since n < T_{D(n)} for large n, and D(n) ~ n * log10(2), the exponent n is a "small" orbit index (n < C*m where C = 1/log10(2) ~ 3.322 and m = D(n)). So finiteness reduces to proving:

   For large m: |S_m intersect [0, C*m]| = 0.

Since the main term is C*m * Z_m/T_m = C*m * (9/10)^m * correction -> 0 exponentially, finiteness follows IF survivors are sufficiently equidistributed among the T_m orbit positions.

## The Digit-Independence Approach

**The survivor indicator factors across digit positions.** Define:
- g_j(i) = 1 if the j-th digit (from the right) of the orbit element at index i is nonzero, else 0
- f_m(i) = g_1(i) * g_2(i) * ... * g_m(i) = 1 iff i is a level-m survivor

Each g_j is a function on Z/T_m Z with mean approximately 9/10.

**Conditional survival rates.** We computed empirically (Experiment 19) the conditional probability P(digit j+1 nonzero | digits 1..j all nonzero). Results for the "generic zone" (orbit indices past the transition zone, m up to 10):

| Digit j | Conditional rate | Expected (9/10) | Ratio |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| 1       | 1.000           | 0.900            | 1.111 |
| 2       | 1.000           | 0.900            | 1.111 |
| 3       | 0.900           | 0.900            | 1.000 |
| 4       | 0.900           | 0.900            | 1.000 |
| 5       | 0.899           | 0.900            | 0.999 |
| 6       | 0.884           | 0.900            | 0.983 |
| 7       | 0.928           | 0.900            | 1.032 |
| 8       | 0.886           | 0.900            | 0.984 |
| 9       | 0.883           | 0.900            | 0.981 |
| 10      | 0.831           | 0.900            | 0.924 |

Notes: Digits 1-2 have rate 1.0 because all orbit elements (being multiples of 2^m but not 10) have nonzero ones and tens digits by construction. From digit 3 onward, the rates fluctuate around 0.9 with deviations of order 0.01-0.07.

**Pairwise independence.** We computed joint/(marginal*marginal) ratios for all digit pairs (Experiment 19). For m=7, scanning 999 elements in the generic zone:

Marginal rates: [1.0, 0.901, 0.900, 0.900, 0.897, 0.916, 0.899]

Joint / (marginal * marginal) ratios:
- Diagonal (d_j, d_j): ~1.11 (= 1/0.9, the self-correlation)
- Off-diagonal adjacent (d_j, d_{j+1}): ~1.00 +/- 0.005
- Off-diagonal non-adjacent: ~1.00 +/- 0.01

The off-diagonal ratios are indistinguishable from 1.0 (independence), except for the diagonal self-correlation.

## The Specific Question

**Can you prove the following, or something close to it?**

**Desired Theorem.** For the 5-adic orbit of 2^n mod 10^m, define the digit indicators g_j(i) as above. There exists a constant C > 0 and a rate 0 < lambda < 1 such that for all j >= 3 and all subsets A of previous-digit outcomes:

P(g_j(i) = 0 | g_1(i) = ... = g_{j-1}(i) = 1) = 1/10 + O(lambda^j)

More precisely, the conditional probability that the j-th digit is zero, given survival of all previous digits, is 1/10 plus an error that decays exponentially in j.

**Why this suffices.** If the conditional probability of failure at each digit is 1/10 + O(lambda^j), then the probability of surviving all m digits is:

Product_{j=1}^{m} (9/10 + O(lambda^j)) = (9/10)^m * (1 + O(sum lambda^j)) = (9/10)^m * (1 + O(1))

So |S_m intersect [0, C*m]| <= C*m * (9/10)^m * O(1) -> 0, giving finiteness.

## Tools Available

**The mod-8 spectral gap.** We have proved that the mod-8 distribution of odd-type survivors converges to uniform at rate (1/3)^m. The transfer matrix is a 4x4 doubly stochastic circulant:

P = (1/3) * [[1,1,1,0],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,1,1],[1,1,0,1]]

with eigenvalues 1, -1/3, i/3, -i/3, giving spectral radius 1/3 away from uniform.

**Can this extend to larger moduli?** The mod-8 result controls whether u mod 2 converges (it does, at rate 1/3). To control the full digit value (not just parity), we would need to track u mod 10, or more ambitiously u mod (2*5^k) for increasing k. The key question is whether the transfer matrices at these higher moduli also have spectral gaps, and whether those gaps are uniform in the modulus.

**Specific sub-question:** For the transfer matrix tracking the distribution of odd survivors modulo 2*5^k (controlling the last k+1 digits of u), what is the spectral gap? Does it stay bounded away from 0 as k grows?

## What I Am Looking For

1. A proof or proof sketch of the digit-independence theorem, with explicit constants.
2. Identification of where the proof might fail (what goes wrong if digits are too correlated?).
3. If a full proof is out of reach, what intermediate results would be valuable? For instance: conditional independence for digits j and j+2 (non-adjacent), or a weaker bound like P(g_j = 0 | ...) in [1/11, 1/9].
4. Literature pointers: has anyone proved conditional digit-independence results for orbits of this type (powers modulo 10^m, or more generally multiplicative orbits in Z/q^m Z)?
