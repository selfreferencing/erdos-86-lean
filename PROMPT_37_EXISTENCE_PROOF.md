# Prompt 37: Existence Proof for ESC Type II Witnesses

## Date: January 21, 2025

## Background

We've established computationally that a finite CRT certificate approach **cannot work** because D_max grows as O(√p). However, K_COMPLETE empirically covers 100% of tested primes (179,468 Mordell-hard primes up to 10^8).

The new goal is an **existence proof** rather than a bounded certificate.

## The Problem

**Prove:** For every prime p ≡ 1 (mod 4), there exists k ∈ K_COMPLETE and d ∈ ℕ such that:
1. d | x_k² where x_k = (p + m_k)/4
2. d ≡ -x_k (mod m_k)
3. gcd(x_k, m_k) = 1

where:
- K_COMPLETE = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, 29, 31, 39, 41}
- m_k = 4k + 3
- The corresponding moduli are: 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 39, 47, 55, 59, 67, 71, 79, 87, 95, 103, 107, 119, 127, 159, 167

**Note:** d is NOT bounded. We just need existence for at least one k.

## Group-Theoretic Reformulation

For each admissible k (where gcd(x_k, m_k) = 1), define:
- H_{x_k} = ⟨p mod m_k : p is prime, p | x_k⟩ ⊆ (ℤ/m_k ℤ)*

Then a witness exists iff **-x_k ∈ H_{x_k}** for some k ∈ K_COMPLETE.

The question becomes: **Why do the 23 moduli m_k ensure at least one "hit"?**

---

## Key Observations

### 1. Admissibility Structure
For p ≡ 1 (mod 4), we have x_k = (p + m_k)/4.
- If m_k ≡ 3 (mod 4), then p + m_k ≡ 0 (mod 4), so x_k is an integer.
- Admissibility (gcd(x_k, m_k) = 1) fails iff some prime q | m_k also divides x_k.

### 2. The 23 Moduli Cover Different Prime Signatures
The moduli m_k have different prime factorizations:
- Primes: 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, 31, 47, 59, 67, 71, 79, 103, 107, 127, 167
- Composite: 15=3×5, 27=3³, 39=3×13, 55=5×11, 87=3×29, 95=5×19, 119=7×17, 159=3×53

### 3. Quadratic Residue Structure
The 6 resistant classes mod 840 are {1, 121, 169, 289, 361, 529} - all perfect squares.
This is the Elsholtz-Tao obstruction: congruence constructions can't eliminate quadratic residues.

But K_COMPLETE **does** cover these classes empirically, just with unbounded d.

### 4. Factorization Diversity
x_k varies with k, so different k values produce different factorizations of x_k.
If x_k has prime factors {q₁, ..., q_r}, then H_{x_k} = ⟨q₁, ..., q_r⟩ mod m_k.

The conjecture is that across the 23 choices of k, at least one produces an H_{x_k} containing -x_k.

## Computational Evidence

### Scan Results (10^8 Mordell-hard primes)
- **Scanned:** 179,468 primes
- **Maximum d required:** 37,281 (p = 76,719,889, k = 5)
- **Primes requiring d > 1500:** 26
- **Coverage:** 100% (every prime has a witness)

### Why Large d Occurs
Example: p = 76,719,889 (requires d = 37,281)
- x_k = (p + 23)/4 = 19,179,978 = 2 × 3 × 17 × 43 × 4373
- Target: d ≡ -x_k (mod 23)
- Smallest matching divisor of x_k²: d = 3 × 17² × 43 = 37,281

The issue: x_k has few small prime factors, and no small combination gives the required residue mod m_k.

### Distribution of k-values in Hard Cases
| k | Count (d > 1500) |
|---|------------------|
| 2 | 4 |
| 5 | 3 |
| 7 | 2 |
| 11 | 2 |
| 14 | 2 |
| 17 | 3 |
| 25 | 3 |
| 26 | 2 |
| 29 | 2 |
| Other | 3 |

No single k dominates the hard cases.

## Possible Proof Approaches

### Approach 1: Density/Measure Argument
Show that the "failure set" (primes where no k works) has density 0, then prove it's actually empty.

### Approach 2: Chinese Remainder Theorem Coverage
The 23 moduli m_k are coprime in various combinations. Their lcm is large (~10^17).
Perhaps every residue class mod this lcm has at least one admissible k with a valid witness.

### Approach 3: Pigeonhole on Group Structure
For each prime p, consider the 23 groups H_{x_k} ⊆ (ℤ/m_k ℤ)*.
Show that the "targets" -x_k cannot all miss their respective groups.

### Approach 4: Character Sum Bounds
Use character sums to bound the probability that -x_k ∉ H_{x_k} for all k simultaneously.

## Specific Questions

1. **Why 23 moduli?** Is there something special about this set, or would any sufficiently large set of coprime moduli work?

2. **Quadratic residue role:** The resistant classes are all squares mod 840. How does this relate to the group-theoretic condition -x_k ∈ H_{x_k}?

3. **Lower bound on admissible k:** For any p ≡ 1 (mod 4), how many k ∈ K_COMPLETE are admissible (gcd(x_k, m_k) = 1)?

4. **Character sum approach:** Can we bound ∑_k 𝟙[-x_k ∉ H_{x_k}] using multiplicative character sums?

---

## What Would Constitute a Proof?

A complete proof would show:

**Theorem:** For every prime p ≡ 1 (mod 4), there exists k ∈ K_COMPLETE such that -x_k ∈ H_{x_k}, where H_{x_k} is the subgroup of (ℤ/m_k ℤ)* generated by the prime factors of x_k.

This is equivalent to saying: the divisors of x_k² (as residues mod m_k) include -x_k for at least one k.

## Summary

The CRT certificate approach is **logically sound** but requires unbounded D_max.
K_COMPLETE empirically covers all primes, but we need a **theoretical proof** that this always holds.

The key insight: we're not trying to bound d anymore. We just need to prove that for at least one k ∈ K_COMPLETE, the group H_{x_k} contains -x_k.
