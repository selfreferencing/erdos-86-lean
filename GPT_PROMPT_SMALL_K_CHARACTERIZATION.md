# TASK: Characterize When Small k (0, 1, 2) Provides a Type II Witness

## Context

For the Erdős-Straus conjecture on Mordell-hard primes, we use Bradford Type II decompositions.

**Key discovery:** k ∈ {0, 1, 2} handles 86.7% of Mordell-hard primes:
- k=0 (m=3): 8,590 primes (41.9%)
- k=1 (m=7): 4,779 primes (23.3%)
- k=2 (m=11): 4,419 primes (21.5%)

The remaining 2,725 primes ("Hard10") are handled by K10 = {5,7,9,11,14,17,19,23,26,29}.

## The Type II Witness Condition

For parameter k with m_k = 4k + 3:
- x_k = (p + m_k) / 4
- Witness exists iff: ∃ d | x_k², d ≤ x_k, d ≡ -x_k (mod m_k)

## YOUR TASK: Characterize Each Small k

### For k=0 (m=3):

x_0 = (p + 3) / 4

**Question 1:** For which Mordell-hard primes p does k=0 provide a witness?

The simplest case: d=1 works iff x_0 ≡ 2 (mod 3), i.e., 1 ≡ -x_0 (mod 3).
- x_0 ≡ 2 (mod 3) ⟺ (p+3)/4 ≡ 2 (mod 3) ⟺ p ≡ 5 (mod 12)

But Mordell-hard primes have p ≡ 1 (mod 12). So d=1 never works for k=0!

**Question 2:** When does some other d work for k=0?

Need d | x_0² with d ≤ x_0 and d ≡ 1 (mod 3) (since -x_0 ≡ -((p+3)/4) ≡ ... mod 3).

Characterize the factorizations of x_0 that allow such a d.

### For k=1 (m=7):

x_1 = (p + 7) / 4

**Question:** For which Mordell-hard primes p does k=1 provide a witness?

d=1 works iff x_1 ≡ 6 (mod 7).

For general d: need d | x_1², d ≤ x_1, d ≡ -x_1 (mod 7).

### For k=2 (m=11):

x_2 = (p + 11) / 4

**Question:** For which Mordell-hard primes p does k=2 provide a witness?

d=1 works iff x_2 ≡ 10 (mod 11).

For general d: need d | x_2², d ≤ x_2, d ≡ -x_2 (mod 11).

## Deliverables

1. **Explicit congruence conditions** on p (mod some modulus M) that characterize when each k ∈ {0,1,2} works.

2. **The "failure region":** Characterize the set of Mordell-hard primes where ALL THREE of k=0, k=1, k=2 fail. This is the Hard10 set.

3. **A clean lemma** of the form:
   ```
   MordellHard p ∧ ¬(condition on p) → TypeII_k0 p ∨ TypeII_k1 p ∨ TypeII_k2 p
   ```

## Useful Facts

- Mordell-hard: p mod 840 ∈ {1, 121, 169, 289, 361, 529}
- All Mordell-hard primes satisfy p ≡ 1 (mod 8) and p ≡ 1 (mod 3)
- p mod 5 ∈ {1, 4} for Mordell-hard primes
- p mod 7 ∈ {1, 2, 4} for Mordell-hard primes

## Note on Divisor Reachability

The set of residues reachable by divisors d | x² (with d ≤ x) modulo m depends on:
1. The prime factorization of x
2. The multiplicative structure of (Z/mZ)*

For m=3: (Z/3Z)* = {1, 2} is cyclic of order 2
For m=7: (Z/7Z)* = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is cyclic of order 6
For m=11: (Z/11Z)* = {1, ..., 10} is cyclic of order 10

The target -x_k is reachable iff it lies in the subgroup generated by the prime factors of x_k.
