# Stage 6B dataset report (10-k cover, p <= 10^7)

This report was generated from `data/kset_certificates_10M.jsonl`.

## Counts

- Total certificates: 20513
- Type counts: {'II': 20495, 'I': 18}
- k counts: {5: 13853, 7: 3804, 9: 1528, 11: 797, 26: 9, 14: 227, 17: 200, 23: 35, 19: 50, 29: 10}

## Notes

- Certificates were generated by scanning the fixed k-set:
  `{5,7,9,11,14,17,19,23,26,29}`.
- Selection policy: **prefer Bradford Type II** (try all k for Type II first),
  and only fall back to Type I when *no* Type II solution exists in the 10-k set.
  This leaves only **18** Type I certificates in the full dataset.
- All certificates satisfy the exact identity:
  `4*x*y*z = p*(x*y + x*z + y*z)` (verified in Python during generation).
