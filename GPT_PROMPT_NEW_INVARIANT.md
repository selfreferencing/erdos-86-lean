# TASK: Find Algebraic Invariant Stronger Than "All Primes Split"

## Context

The obstruction O_k ("all prime factors of x_k have (q/m_k) = +1") is NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT for K10 failure.

**Proven by GPT2:** O_k does NOT imply principal genus. So we cannot use norm equations or Faltings.

**But:** Even when O_k holds, there often exists a witness d ≤ x_k with d ≡ -x_k (mod m_k).

## The Gap

O_k says: The multiplicative subgroup generated by prime factors of x_k lies in the QR subgroup of (Z/m_k Z)*.

But witness existence requires: The target -x_k mod m_k is reachable by divisors of x_k² that are ≤ x_k.

These are different conditions!

## What Determines Witness Existence?

Let x_k = q_1^{e_1} × ... × q_r^{e_r} be the prime factorization.

Divisors of x_k² are products q_1^{a_1} × ... × q_r^{a_r} with 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2e_i.

The residues mod m_k form the subgroup ⟨q_1, ..., q_r⟩ in (Z/m_k Z)*.

For witness to exist: -x_k mod m_k must be in this subgroup AND achievable by a product ≤ x_k.

## YOUR TASK

Find an algebraic invariant I(x_k, m_k) such that:

1. I(x_k, m_k) = true → witness exists (sufficient condition)
2. I is easier to verify/prove than exhaustive divisor search
3. I can be shown to hold for Hard10 primes via algebraic arguments

## Candidate Invariants

### Candidate 1: Subgroup Index

If the subgroup ⟨prime factors⟩ has index ≤ 2 in (Z/m_k Z)*, then -x_k is usually reachable.

More precisely: If index = 1 (full group), always reachable. If index = 2, reachable iff -x_k is in the subgroup.

### Candidate 2: Primitive Root Present

If some prime factor q is a primitive root mod m_k, then ⟨q⟩ = (Z/m_k Z)*, so -x_k is always reachable.

Question: For Hard10 primes, does some x_k always have a primitive root factor?

### Candidate 3: Size-Based Reachability

For large x_k with many prime factors, the "small divisor" constraint (d ≤ x_k) becomes loose.

If x_k has ≥ log(m_k) distinct prime factors, can we guarantee witness existence?

### Candidate 4: Ideal Class Constraint

Going beyond splitting: If prime factors of x_k generate a specific ideal class in the class group of Q(√(-m_k)), this might force witness existence.

## The Interaction Angle

For ALL k ∈ K10 to fail:
- Each x_k must have the witness condition fail
- But the x_k share the base r = (p+3)/4
- Can the invariants I(x_k, m_k) be shown to conflict across different k?

## Deliverable

1. Propose a concrete invariant I(x_k, m_k)
2. Prove: I(x_k, m_k) = true → witness exists
3. Show: For Hard10 primes, I holds for at least one k ∈ K10

Or: Prove no such simple invariant exists and the problem is fundamentally computational.
